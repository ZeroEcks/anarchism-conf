          <p>Copy goes here</p>
          <p>It'll be like serif and kinda like this. Someone else will write it later too, it won't be Mel that's for sure.</p>
          <p>I reckon we should say something like, idk, 'anarchy conf is happening in melbourne! wow! you should come! we will open at 7am and finish at 3pm (because anarchism requires dicipline ) and will probably have like, some workshops and stuff on workplace organising (but definitely nothing cringe.). Please register your attendance maybe??? i can put a form below.'</p>
          <p>We are also going to maybe take submissions for having workshops? are we? idk. but if we are, you should tell Mel so she can put that on the website yeah?</p>
          <p> anyway the copy will be about this long, does that seem about right?</p>
